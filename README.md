Teamwork.com Golang test

## Details
* Open file
* Read content
* Parse email and find domain
* Place in map with unique keys (domains) + count entires

* Implimented a test for the email parser

### Notes:
* Found that Split method was faster than regex for obtaining the email domain
* Have a smaal version 2 to see how reader.Read() compares to reader.ReadAll()

I really enjoyed learning and playing with Go. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
